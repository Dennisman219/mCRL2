tracepp
=======

The tool :ref:`tracepp <_tool-tracepp>` pretty prints the content 
of a trace file in various human readable output formats. A proviso is that the requested information, esp.,
information about state vectors, must be present in the trace. If no 
explicit input trace file is given, input is read from stdin.
