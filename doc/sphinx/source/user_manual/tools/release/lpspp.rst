lpspp
=====

The tool :ref:`lpspp <tool-lpspp>` is intended to pretty print
linear process specifications in a human readable form. It has
an option to print a linear process in internal aterm format, but this
is for deep debugging purposes only. If no input and output filenames are given, 
it reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
