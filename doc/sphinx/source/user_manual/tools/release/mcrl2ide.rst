mcrl2ide
=========

mcrl2ide is a graphical integrated development environment aimed at new users to
use the mCRL2 tool-set and its language. With this tool the user can

* write and validate an mCRL2 specification
* simulate the mCRL2 specification
* create, reduce and view the state space of the mCRL2 specification
* define properties and verify them on the mCRL2 specification
* create and view the evidence for these properties

..note::

   For Mac users: in the 201808.0 release version of mcrl2 mcrl2ide uses relative
   paths to find tools. Due to this, mcrl2ide cannot find the other tools when
   starting it via Finder. It does work when mcrl2ide is started from the terminal.
   
..note::

   Although mcrl2ide is marked as a release tool, it is still in developement.
