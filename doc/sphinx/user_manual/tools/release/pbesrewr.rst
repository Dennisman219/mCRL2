========

This tool is can be used to apply one of several rewriters on a parameterised
Boolean equation system. The list of available rewriters can be found in the
manual page below. Most rewriters either simplify the PBES or rewrite it to some
normal form. Specifications of the rewriters can be found on
`<https://mcrl2.org/web/developer_manual/developer.html>` in the `PBES rewriters`
document.
