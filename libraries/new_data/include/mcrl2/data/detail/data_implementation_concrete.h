/** \brief     Implement data types of a type checked mCRL2 action rename
 *             specification with respect to a type checked mCRL2 linear
 *             process specification (LPS).
 *             This is a detailed implemenation, in order to prevent cluttering
 *             of the actual interface of data_implementation_concrete.h
 *  \param[in] ar_spec An ATerm representation of an mCRL2 action rename
 *             specification that adheres to the internal ATerm
 *             structure after the type checking phase.
 *  \param[in] spec An ATerm representation of an mCRL2 LPS that adheres
 *             to the internal ATerm structure after the type checking phase.
 *  \post      The data types in action_rename_spec are implemented as
 *             higher-order abstract data types types and the data types
 *             of lps_spec are added to the data types of ar_spec.  The
 *             datatypes of lps_spec are implemented as higher-order
 *             abstract data types in lps_spec
 *  \return    If the data implementation went well, an equivalent
 *             version of ar_spec is returned that adheres to the
 *             internal ATerm structure after data implementation, also
 *             containing the data specification of lps_spec If
 *             something went wrong, an appropriate error message is
 *             printed and NULL is returned.
